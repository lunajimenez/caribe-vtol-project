# Python Dynamic Models

Python implementation of the full dynamic model:
- T1: Rotational dynamics (Euler equations)
- T2: Translational dynamics (3D forces and motion)
- T3: Mass and inertia estimation
- T4–T5: Motor thrust models
- T6: Aerodynamic control surfaces
- T7: Lift/drag lookup tables
- T8: Transition model
- T9: Numerical stability checks

Folder to develop modular, testable Python scripts.
